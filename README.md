# Varg

A simple (perhaps too much so) Odin library for CLI argument parsing.

## Usage

Check out [the example](./example/simple.odin) for an overview. Varg parses commands (simple strings), flags (short or long boolean switches), and arguments (like flags, but require a value).

## Notes

I wrote this library on a whim to satisfy my own needs. Consider it a minimum viable product at this stage. I may or may not continue adding improvements. If you find it useful but lacking, feel free to submit a PR or fork the project. :)
